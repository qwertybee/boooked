## What features that you cannot complete (explain why so)

## What features shall be added (if you would have more time)
- Since this project is only from customer's POV, if I had more time I would make another side of library website that includes database for staff to access and modify (i.e. adding/removing books in the library, update user's book status, other admin privileges, etc.).
- I'd also like to add sorting by genre but with bars that categorize each genre and also create buttons from A-Z that jumps to each label bars that contains books from its sort.
